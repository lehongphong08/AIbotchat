Hello! In a moment you will begin chatting with Machine Learning Conversational
Program, or MLCP. Everything you say he will learn, and every response you make
he will remember. The goal is that he will someday be able to talk. Type 
"#help" to learn more. To quit the program, type "#quit" into the command 
prompt.
"""
helpmes = """This is the help message for MLCP. 

In order to communicate with the bot, simply type what you want to say into the
input space. When typing please use only lower case characters and no special
characters.

So this: 
"You're a real star!"

Becomes this:
"youre a real star"

The reason for this is that otherwise you would have many entries that are 
copies of the same word, ie Hey, hey, hey! and Hey all mean the same thing
but would be entered differently.

Sometimes what the bot says can be hard to interpret, but keep trying and
use your imagination.
